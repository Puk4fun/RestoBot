# RestoBot

An interactive Chat Application that answers restaurant based questions.

To run this program first download Yelp Dataset from https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset

Setup MongoDB instance in local machine or in a cloud environment such as AWS or Google Cloud. (I prefer google cloud as they provide good hardware resource for the free tier) 

Insert the data into MongoDB. To do this run the file yelp-business.py and yelp-reviews.py

To ask any questions, run ChatbotMain program and enter your question. 

Some of the questions answered by the chatbot are:
